“I'll continue to post these Fog of War Updates when possible to give more clarity.

I continue to stress that this is just an opinion and analysis, one can take it, or leave it.

The reason for the urgency of my past posts is this.

As we have all seen, every day continues to be worse than the day before.

Every day, Israel continues and escalates their push more and more.

The report that they will continue to expand to "Lebanese targets" just makes sense. It makes sense because I believe we have already seen that happen day after day.

With Hezbollah seeming to start depleting their stockpile, it also reinforces this idea.

Why would Israel stop now if all it may take for them is another few more days or a week of escalation until Hezbollah fully submits?

This escalation will be accompanied by an expansion of their targeting in Beirut and around the country.

The more pressure for them, the better.

Given this, the prepare for the worst warning means this:

Eventually, as this push continues to intensify and widen, the targeting may become too close to home. May hit near you.

Talks of a ceasefire have already died down, meaning this push will likely continue.

All I am saying is, please be careful.

I am so sorry, I just need to say what I see. That is the job I've given myself since this began. Take it, or leave it.”
