“For those still playing with fire staying in Beirut, please don’t.

Prepare for the worst.

If you can, please make arrangements to leave Beirut, at least temporarily, out of an abundance of caution. 

Things are not looking good anymore.

I don’t want to turn people’s emotions into a see saw.

All I am saying, is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.

Preparing for the worst means making these arrangements if you can.

I will continue to update, while being as careful as I can not dragging people’s emotions.

I will wait for concrete confirmation of claims and reports as best as possible before reporting here.

Please stay safe everyone.”
