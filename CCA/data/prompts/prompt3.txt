“While it’s a big day in Lebanon, an update on the LA fires is necessary.

They have gone from bad to worse. It’s a crazy sight.

Apart from leading to massive devastation in the Pacific Palisades area of the city, new fires have now broken out in the Hollywood Hills and Studio City.

The inferno has led to at least 5 deaths, 2000 structures destroyed, and $50 billion in damage.

These are happening in landmark areas in the city.

Many of these fires are still 0% contained.”
