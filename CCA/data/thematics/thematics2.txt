Text: Macron's new PM Bayrou faces 'long road' against fractious French parliament

French President Emmanuel Macron named key ally Francois Bayrou as his fourth prime minister of 2024 on Friday, but the scale of the challenge facing the veteran centrist was immediately clear as the Socialist Party refused to join his coalition government.

Bayrou, 73, gave a sober assessment of whether he could tame a hung parliament that ousted his predecessor, Michel Barnier, just last week.

"It is a long road, everyone knows that," he told reporters. "I am not the first to take a long road."

France's festering political malaise has raised doubts about whether Macron will complete his second presidential term until 2027.

Text: New French PM Bayrou will meet far-right leader Le Pen on Monday

New French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou will meet with the heads of parliamentary groups on Monday and Tuesday, starting with Marine Le Pen of the far-right Rassemblement National, he told La Tribune Dimanche in an interview.

Bayrou, whose appointment on Friday made him the fourth person to serve as French prime minister this year, will be responsible for steering a 2025 budget through the fractious parliament. It was the same task that ultimately toppled his predecessor Michel Barnier, whose three-month tenure was the shortest in modern French history.

New French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said on Monday that power will be restored to all households on the storm-ravaged Mayotte archipelago by the end of January, while the rebuilding of its shantytowns will not be permitted.

Text: French PM's concessions on pensions eyed in key policy speech

French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is expected to lay out in a speech on Tuesday the contours of a deal to water down pension reforms in return for support from the left on passing a budget.

The speech comes after a tumultuous 2024 for France when President Emmanuel Macron shocked the nation by calling early elections, only to lose his working majority in parliament just as the public finances went off track.

Bayrou's government, which was formed last month after the collapse of his predecessor's administration, is trying to win assurances from some opposition parties and the Socialists in particular that they will not vote against its 2025 budget.

Text: Key quotes from French Prime Minister Bayrou's parliamentary address

DEBT:

"There are countless causes for concern. However, there is one that emerges with glaring force: our country's over-indebtedness."

Text: French Socialist Party raises threat of backing no-confidence vote against government

The French Socialist Party, whose support Francois Bayrou's minority government has been trying to secure for weeks, on Tuesday raised the threat of backing a no-confidence vote against the government later this week.

The Socialists, who voted down previous budget proposals in December in conjunction with far-right lawmakers and thereby precipitated the fall of Michel Barnier's government, have made concessions on the 2023 pension reform a condition for support.
