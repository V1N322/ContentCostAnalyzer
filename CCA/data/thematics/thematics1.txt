Text: US Vice President Kamala Harris' Los Angeles home has been placed within an evacuation zone due to a wildfire in California, NBC News reported.

The 350-square-meter house, located in an upscale Los Angeles neighborhood, was purchased in 2012 by Kamala Harris' husband, attorney Douglas Emhoff. Actress Gwyneth Paltrow and basketball star LeBron James are her neighbors. The four-bedroom home, which features a pool, is just a 10-minute walk from the Getty Museum. In 2024, the property was valued at $5 million.

Earlier reports from US media indicated that the California wildfire has spread over 740 acres and continues to grow.

Cal Fire has its own fleet of aircraft operating from 14 airfields and 11 helicopter bases across the state that can reach most fires within about 20 minutes. The three main components of the fleet are tactical planes, airtankers and helicopters. All have specific roles but work together as a unit to combat fires.[Media]Map showing multiple flight paths of firefighting aircraft around the Palisades Fire in Los Angeles.

The largest of the raging wildfires that have devastated parts of Los Angeles this week was reported to have shifted direction on Saturday, triggering more evacuation orders and posing a new challenge to exhausted firefighters.

Six simultaneous blazes that have ripped across Los Angeles County neighborhoods since Tuesday have killed at least 11 people and damaged or destroyed 10,000 structures. The toll is expected to mount when firefighters are able to conduct house-to-house searches.

Text: See Pacific Palisades before and after the devastating Los Angeles fires

Before one of the most destructive fires in California history swept through, the Pacific Palisades neighborhood on Los Angeles' west side was filled with expensive homes fronted by green, well-tended landscaping and popular boutiques and cafes.

This week, the Palisades Fire leveled much of it to blackened rubble. To see what has been lost, a Reuters video journalist visited the neighborhood on Friday to retrace the path taken by a YouTube travel influencer couple who made a video last year of a walking tour, which is being reproduced with their permission.

Firefighters were slowly making progress in their battle to contain the inferno that has burned wide areas of Los Angeles' Pacific Palisades neighborhood to the ground, but spreading flames and strong winds still threatened communities in the populous San Fernando Valley on Sunday.

Aircraft dropped water and fire retardant on steep hills to stem the eastward spread of the Palisades Fire and KTLA television reported that ground crews had managed to save a number of houses, although others were lost.

"LA County had another night of unimaginable terror and heartbreak," Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath said.

The Los Angeles wildfires, which have reduced entire neighborhoods to smoldering ruins and left an apocalyptic landscape, could become the costliest wildfires in U.S. history in terms of insured losses if analysts' estimates of up to $20 billion materialize.

Dangerously high winds were expected to resume on Monday in Los Angeles, potentially hampering efforts to extinguish two stubborn wildfires that have claimed the lives of at least two dozen people.

Rescue workers in northern Peru were searching for trapped miners at a small gold mine on Monday , after the mine was allegedly attacked by suspected illegal miners, a local mayor said.

Segundo Armas, mayor of the Pataz district in the region of La Libertad, said that as many as 17 miners could be trapped at the small remote mine which collapsed after it was attacked on Sunday by "possibly rival miners."

The mayor was unable to confirm how many workers had been able to escape.

"The area is difficult to access and we are trying to confirm the number of those trapped," Armas said, adding that cellular service does not reach the mine.

Text: Benin festival seeks to dispel voodoo stereotypes

Modeste Zinsou, manager of Benin's Python Temple, gently drapes a live snake around a visitor's neck at the country's annual voodoo festival, as spectators learn about the reptiles' sacred connection to voodoo spirituality.

Practitioners like Zinsou seek to combat negative stereotypes of voodoo, a 500-year-old religion that celebrates a rich pantheon of deities and spirits.

"Stop saying that voodoo is about dolls. Voodoo is spirituality. Voodoo is you, it's me. It's the air we breathe. It's the four elements, as we say: water, air, fire, and earth," Zinsou said.

Every January, the festival Vodun Days draws tourists and worshippers to the small Atlantic coast town of Ouidah, offering a varied programme of ceremonies, concerts and exhibitions.
