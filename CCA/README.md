Here is example post to inherit style:
“I'll continue to post these Fog of War Updates when possible to give more clarity.

I continue to stress that this is just an opinion and analysis, one can take it, or leave it.

The reason for the urgency of my past posts is this.

As we have all seen, every day continues to be worse than the day before.

Every day, Israel continues and escalates their push more and more.

The report that they will continue to expand to "Lebanese targets" just makes sense. It makes sense because I believe we have already seen that happen day after day.

With Hezbollah seeming to start depleting their stockpile, it also reinforces this idea.

Why would Israel stop now if all it may take for them is another few more days or a week of escalation until Hezbollah fully submits?

This escalation will be accompanied by an expansion of their targeting in Beirut and around the country.

The more pressure for them, the better.

Given this, the prepare for the worst warning means this:

Eventually, as this push continues to intensify and widen, the targeting may become too close to home. May hit near you.

Talks of a ceasefire have already died down, meaning this push will likely continue.

All I am saying is, please be careful.

I am so sorry, I just need to say what I see. That is the job I've given myself since this began. Take it, or leave it.”

Here is example post to inherit style:
“For those still playing with fire staying in Beirut, please don’t.

Prepare for the worst.

If you can, please make arrangements to leave Beirut, at least temporarily, out of an abundance of caution. 

Things are not looking good anymore.

I don’t want to turn people’s emotions into a see saw.

All I am saying, is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.

Preparing for the worst means making these arrangements if you can.

I will continue to update, while being as careful as I can not dragging people’s emotions.

I will wait for concrete confirmation of claims and reports as best as possible before reporting here.

Please stay safe everyone.”

Промпт 3:

Create a neutral text based on the summary of posts below. Focus on facts and a clear structure of the text. Avoid subjective judgments or emotional coloring. Highlight key data using simple and clear formulations. Text length: from 500 to 1000 characters.
Example text structure: Description of the current situation. Brief presentation of statistics or key data. Clarification of the current status or consequences. Conclusion with a neutral assessment.
Here is example post to inherit style:
“While it’s a big day in Lebanon, an update on the LA fires is necessary.

They have gone from bad to worse. It’s a crazy sight.

Apart from leading to massive devastation in the Pacific Palisades area of the city, new fires have now broken out in the Hollywood Hills and Studio City.

The inferno has led to at least 5 deaths, 2000 structures destroyed, and $50 billion in damage.

These are happening in landmark areas in the city.

Many of these fires are still 0% contained.”
